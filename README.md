## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/abhinav744/supervised-ml-regression-classification.git

cd supervised-ml-regression-classification

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

If no requirements.txt is available, install the libraries manually:

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
